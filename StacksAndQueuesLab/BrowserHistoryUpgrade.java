/*
Extend "Browser History" with a "forward" instruction, which visits URLs that were navigated away from by
"back".
Each forward instruction visits the next most recent such URL. If normal navigation happens, all potential forward
URLs are removed until a new back instruction is given if the forward instruction canâ€™t be executed, print
"no next URLs".
